# Medical-Insurance-Project

This is my first real portfolio project, which I conducted after completing python fundamentals in codeacademy. The project allowed for a large amount of freedom,
as far as what I chose to do with the data. We were given a Excel file of insurance data and were asked to import the file and create an analysis of the data, 
what we chose to analyze was up to us.
