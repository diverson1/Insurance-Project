# Medical-Insurance-Project

This was my first real portfolio project, which I conducted after completing python fundamentals in codeacademy. We were given an Excel file of insurance data and were asked to import the file and conduct an analysis of the data, what we chose to analyze was up to us. I decided to compare the affect that age vs gender had on total insurance cost.

The juypter notebook file was the original project I wrote, and the file titled original script is the notebook convereted to a python file. 

The goal is to continue to comeback and improve upon the orginial code so that I can track the progression of my understanding.

Current improved variations:
Utilizing_Dataframes_and_SQL - focused on using sql queirie
Utilizing_Dataframes_Pandas - focused on using different panda operations
