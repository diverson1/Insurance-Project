# Medical-Insurance-Project

This is my first real portfolio project, which I conducted after completing python fundamentals in codeacademy. We were given an Excel file of insurance data and were asked to import the file and conduct an analysis of the data, what we chose to analyze was up to us. I decided to compare the affect that age vs gender had on total insurance cost.
